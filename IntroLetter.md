Dear Professor 

I am Jincheng Li graduated from Ajou University for Master Degree. My Master thesis is "Legacy ECU Software System Analysis Method for AUTOSAR Migration". I am now working at web development department of Citi Group as senior web developer in Shanghai, China. Before that, I had been working at Chemessen as senior technical staff in Seoul, Korea for almost two years. When I was in Chemessen, I had developed a prototype of Chemical Predictor by using Tensorflow`s DNN model. This predictor had been proven to be more accurate than the predictor made before.

Various woking and research expirences made me interested at areas related to **Artificial Intelligence**, **Smart Factory** and **IOT**. I am very fascinated by your work, especially for the research and work of **Situation & Gesture Recognition** and **Brain-Machine Interface**.

I greatly want to apply for your PhD program this year. May I ask you do you have plan to take PhD students this year?

Would you please reply me at your convenience?

Attached is my CV.

Best Regards!

Jincheng Li
